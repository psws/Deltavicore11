If you are running under Microsoft Visual Studio the user is IIS_Users
Server=PSS60\\SQL2014;Database=Expenses;Persist Security Info=False;user id=jims9m8r;password=jims9m8r;Integrated Security=true;MultipleActiveResultSets=true

If you are running from a Browser: http://localhost:8092/admin/providers Integrated Secrity must be false. If not you will get this error:
	"DbInitializer":error "Login failed for user 'NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON
INTEGRATED SECURITY:
When false, User ID and Password are specified in the connection. When true, the current Windows account credentials are used for authentication.
Recognized values are true, false, yes, no, and sspi (strongly recommended), which is equivalent to true.

PERSIST SECRITY:
Persist Security = true means that the Password used for SQL authentication is not removed from the ConnectionString property of the connection.
When Integrated Security = true is used then the Persist Security is completely irelevant since it only applies to SQL authentication, not to windows/Integrated/SSPI.
 I am sure setting Persist Security Info to True makes sense in certain scenarios, but the overall trend and recommendation for production environments is to set it to False. 
 I should note that False is the default setting, so you can leave out the explicit setting from your connection string

 SSPI:
 SSPI stands for Security Support Provider Interface. The SSPI allows an application to use any of the available security packages on a system without changing the interface to use security services. The SSPI does not establish logon credentials
 because that is generally a privileged operation handled by the operating system.
 Integrated Security=true; doesn't work in all SQL providers, it throws an exception when used with the OleDb provider. So basically Integrated Security=SSPI; 
 is preferred since works with both SQLClient & OleDB provid
