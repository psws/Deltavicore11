The Deltavicore11.webapi project contains an ErrorHandlingMiddleware.cs file

This middleware api catches exceptions globally and returns a reponse to the client.
The angular routing file on the client is never reached.

The HandleExceptionAsync() method determines which status code to return in the JSON response.

To install this middleware add the following to startup.cs file
	            app.UseMiddleware(typeof(ErrorHandlingMiddleware));
This line must be before
	app.UseStaticFiles();
 and 
	app.UseMvc()

NOTE: If you enable app.UseMiddleware(typeof(ErrorHandlingMiddleware)) in startup.cs, 
	the app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage() WILL NOT BE DISPLAYED..
	This is due to the middleware intercepting the response.
