	IMPORTANT!!!!!
	in the Package Manager Console:
		cd uiroute.app
	pwd shows the PMC urrent directory.
	You need to be in the directory so the .bowerrc file is found
	please generate the .bowerrc  file in the uiroute.app directory

			}
	This sets the target directory for bower packages


The scrollable tabs requires angular 1.5.11
1>1.6.x will not resolve on bower.(scrollable tab 1.5.x deopendency)

Force angular to 1.5.11:
	bower istall angular@1.5.11
Make sure all other packages the depend on angulasr are instaslled as
  bower install <package name>@1.5.11
  most pkgs will resole to the 1.5.11 version without the '@'
Carefully read the Package Manager conflict window.
	it will inform you of resolve issues.

AFTER PKGS are installed with Bower.	
	The css and js files are not added to the project automatically
	You need to create a bower_components directory under uirout.app
		create a directory for each Pkg under bower_components
			Add the css and Js files to these directories
	Modify the _layout.cshtml file to point to these new pkg directories
