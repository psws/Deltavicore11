uiroute is a .net4.6 project
	THIS INFO IS NOT FOR A .NET CORE PROJECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MS has not done much work with .net standard.
Most of the bower work has been done for .net core.

After following the directions in Adding pkgs to a .net4 standard project.txt

When adding files to the bower_components sub directories
	make sure you get all thaat is needed (.js, .css, .map, fonts...)
	It is best to mimic the bower pkg directory structure in VS2017.

Mistakes I made.
	The scrollable tab arrow icons were missing.
	in bootstrap directory I did not put the dist sub dir.
	I just put .css under bootstrap.
		The scrollable tab uses arrows from the bootstrap/dist/fonts directory.
		be sure to add these fonts.
		This took 2 days to find!!!!!!!
		using the f12 debugger, I noticed tha a font file was being doenloaded when the arrows appeared.
			This font file was lookin at bower_components/fonts for the font file.
			This was caused when the fonts were not found in the bower_components/bootstrap/dist/fonts 

	In the angular-uu-grid directory, ui-grid is expecting to find the 4 uigrid font files at the top level
		I added these to the project.
