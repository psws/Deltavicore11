Original project was deltaviCore11.web application
this netcore11 project ran fine in IIS Expres but NOT in Win IIS.

The problem was narroed down to the space between .web and application
This Error was displaywd when browsing to the page:

	HTTP Error 502.5 - Process Failure 



	Common causes of this issue: 
	• The application process failed to start 
	• The application process started but then stopped 
	• The application process started but failed to listen on the configured port 



	Troubleshooting steps: 
	• Check the system event log for error messages 
	• Enable logging the application process’ stdout messages

I created a new peoject with proj name of Deltavicore11.web_app and this works fine.

In  the failed project the web.config fie
had:
	<aspNetCore processPath="dotnet" arguments=".\deltaviCore11.web application.dll" stdoutLogEnabled="false" stdoutLogFile=".\logs\stdout" />

When I browsed to localhost:8089 The event viewer showed:

I modified the web.config file:
		<aspNetCore processPath="dotnet" arguments=".\deltaviCore11.web application.dll" stdoutLogEnabled="true" stdoutLogFile=".\logs\stdout" />
This turned on app logging.
It did not work until I creared the 'logs' directory in the Publish target directory.
Alog file was written with this error:
	".\deltaviCore11.web was not found.

THUS WAS THE ERRO, The space was no good!
